# ClusterReplication

Status: implementation in progress. Owner: KeyLoad lead. The owner's Orleans-only correction supersedes the DotNext candidate in architecture v0.3. Decision: [ADR-036](../ADR/ADR-036-orleans-foundation.md).

REQ-REP-052 / AC-DBHP-001..008 adds the accepted preserving
[bounded replica term metadata](ClusterReplication/ReplicaTermMetadata.md) work
under [ADR-061](../ADR/ADR-061-bounded-replica-term-metadata.md). This private
node-log scalar observation retains actual provider read checks and both public
authorized quorum barriers. Implementation/native performance proof remains open.

| Requirement | Acceptance and observable evidence |
|---|---|
| REQ-REP-001: Orleans carries votes, ordered appends, read barriers, forwarding and snapshot transfer. No DotNext runtime/package remains. | AC-REP-001: dependency/source inventory contains no DotNext reference; three Docker silos accept .NET SDK operations through request grains. |
| REQ-REP-002: terms, votes, log entries and commit positions are node-owned and process durable before acknowledgement. | AC-REP-002: real-process append/vote/commit interruption tests reopen the acknowledged prefix and reject complete-record corruption. |
| REQ-REP-003: an odd fixed RF3 voter set commits only with a majority; a current-term quorum barrier precedes public reads. | AC-REP-003: leader kill preserves acknowledged commands and stable-ID outcomes; an isolated minority rejects reads and writes. |
| REQ-REP-004: a restarted/empty replica catches up by a verified bounded snapshot followed by the ordered tail. | AC-REP-004: SDK-visible documents, topic/checkpoint/outbox/inbox outcomes survive replica erase/restart; interrupted/corrupt transfers preserve a complete recoverable cut. |
| REQ-REP-005: replicated principals and grants remain authoritative, including after leadership changes and snapshot catch-up. | AC-REP-005: SDK/MCP unauthorized and protected-field requests fail without canonical effects before and after failover. |
| REQ-REP-006: bounded anti-replay admission retains reserved capacity for votes, heartbeats, noop/current-term establishment and membership/lease control when application traffic saturates. | AC-REP-006: signed replay/tamper requests are rejected; saturated forward/read/data-append traffic is throttled without exhausting control capacity; real RF3 client load preserves leadership and minority denial. |

Slice map: `src/KeyLoad.Replication/Features/ClusterReplication/` owns protocol/log contracts and coordination; `src/KeyLoad.Orleans/Features/ClusterReplication/` owns the per-silo service/transport; `src/KeyLoad.AppHost/Features/ClusterReplication/` owns Docker resource composition; recovery and integration tests mirror `Features/ClusterReplication/`. Node storage adapter remains StorageRecovery. Frontend: N/A, this protocol has no UI. Public client shapes: existing ClientApi contracts; user-visible guarantees remain stable.

Traceability: AC-REP-001/003/004 map to `ClusterTests` and the new replica recovery tests; AC-REP-002 maps to real CrashHost interruption scenarios; AC-REP-005 maps to authorization/failover client cases. TASK-REP-LOG, TASK-REP-TRANSPORT, TASK-REP-INTEGRATE and TASK-REP-VERIFY are defined in [execution plan](../ADR/ADR-036-orleans-foundation.md). Qualification is GitHub Actions only. Historical CI 36926803549 qualifies the old implementation, not this replacement. Power-loss and endurance remain pending.

TASK-RUNTIME-REPLICA-READINESS-W4 maps REQ-REP-004 / AC-REP-004 and
REQ/AC-STORAGE-012. Exact main b533c80 / CI37032546228 fails the Windows
SnapshotInstalled reopen on target/database/tree/0.meta.wal; the prior two-store
barrier probes only owner.lock and commands.wal. Root replaces each store's
probe with the shared StorageRecovery exclusive-file probe, including metadata
when present, inside the existing single five-second/25ms loop. Cancellation
stops before another probe. No file creation, recovery retry, timeout increase,
weakened snapshot/tail/receipt predicate or attribution of the unknown holder
is permitted. A disjoint test worker owns new ClusterReplication real-file
barrier cases: hold canonical or replica metadata exclusively, verify pending
then release and success; cancel a held wait and pre-cancel an unlocked wait;
assert a permanent holder still fails under the unchanged bound. Use actual
closed CrashHost target stores and observe/dispose pending tasks and holders
before deleting their root. Existing native SnapshotInstalled process-kill and
ordered-tail tests are the primary regression. ADR-035/036/041 ownership and
lifetime contracts suffice; public/data/dependency boundaries are unchanged.
Root reviews both helper/caller scopes together, development-builds/formats,
and qualifies the full three-OS recovery suite in GitHub at the delivered SHA.

The same W4 criterion includes exact1bee2609 / CI37036628601's source-store
reopen failures. For the six typed snapshot/transfer crash boundaries, the child
also opened `source/database` and `source/replica`. Enumerate these exact owned
stores alongside the target stores inside the same single five-second/25ms loop.
Use the crash boundary's explicit source-ownership contract, never filesystem
existence to decide whether required ownership/journal files are optional. Other
boundaries retain their target-only path and must not create source storage.
Root owns the CrashHost store-path/source-boundary helpers, preserving the
existing scenario predicate, and ReplicaProcessTrial/ReplicaProcessFiles join.
The disjoint readiness test worker extends only its real-store fixture and cases:
each source canonical/replica owner, journal and metadata holder keeps the actual
combined wait pending until released. Existing source snapshot import and private
transfer crash cases remain the primary regression and retain all assertions.

The two permanent-holder elapsed checks and StorageRecovery's two missing-required-
file arguments retain their five-second lower and six-second upper observation
bounds. Run only those individual wall-clock measurement cases with TUnit's
keyless method-level `NotInParallel`, which the
pinned1.72.10 package documents as exclusive execution. Exact Windows evidence
shows the failed check overlapped74 distinct cases with16 active at peak; timer
or continuation delay is a supported inference, without a threadpool trace.
No class/assembly serialization, retry or timeout increase is allowed. Other
holder-release/cancellation tests and every real process crash remain parallel.
This is intrinsic readiness timing qualification, not a loaded-system latency
claim. Source review, native case discovery and full exact-SHA CI must verify
that the same bounds and all original crash cases remain.

TASK-RUNTIME-MAC-FIXTURE-W6 refines AC-REP-004 / AC-STORAGE-012 after
exact323d60499 / CI37044499074. All11 new macOS readiness cases fail during
construction at ReplicaSnapshotFiles.RejectLinks' reparse-point rejection,
before snapshot-data or readiness predicates. The fixture allocates an unresolved
system temp path; macOS temp aliases are the source-supported cause, while the
native report does not expose that run's exact TMPDIR. Reuse CrashHost's existing
ReplicaFixturePaths.NewDirectory for the fresh owned root, as other real replica
fixtures already do. It resolves existing directory ancestors using native .NET
ResolveLinkTarget before the private root is created; production RejectLinks
remains unchanged and fail-closed. Preserve one root, shared incarnation, both
target stores and required source stores, closure order, actual exclusive holders,
waits/assertions and owned cleanup. No second resolver, guard bypass, dependency,
public contract or persistence migration is introduced. The worker owns only
ReplicaFileReadinessStores; root owns contract/diff/evidence integration. All11
formerly red native cases plus original snapshot/tail/process recovery across
three OSes are the regression matrix. AC-REC-FUP-001 requires the existing
physical-temp helper and unchanged fail-closed guard; AC-REC-FUP-002 requires the
same genuine source/target stores, incarnation, holders, assertions and cleanup.
Either criterion fails on setup rejection, changed ownership or leaked work;
all11 native cases and original snapshot/tail cases must pass. ADR035/036/033 cover this preserving private
fixture reuse; rollback reverts only the allocator call. Environmental path or
cleanup failures require source lifetime review rather than a synthetic injector.

## Actors, entry points and failure boundaries

Actors are authenticated SDK/MCP callers, the node-local replica host, fixed voters, the membership provider and the recovery operator. Current source is composed by [ServerApplication](../../src/KeyLoad.Server/Features/ClientApi/Hosting/ServerApplication.cs): it starts the node-local [PartitionHost](../../src/KeyLoad.Server/Features/StorageRecovery/Hosting/PartitionHost.cs) and Orleans silo, whose [replica service](../../src/KeyLoad.Orleans/Features/ClusterReplication/GrainServices/PartitionReplicaGrainService.cs) routes peer operations. Aspire declares three Docker nodes with separate data mounts. This source is not yet qualified as a delivered RF3 deployment: current tests do not force request-activation migration and then verify storage ownership and a durable caller-visible outcome. Public HTTP/.NET transport belongs to ClientApi; required official MCP parity is pending. Frontend is N/A because replica consensus has no independent UI. Shared contracts stay in Abstractions and the exact ClusterReplication/StorageRecovery slice owners above.

Positive flow: an authorized command reaches its own request grain, the physical host orders and persists it, a majority crosses the declared acknowledgement barrier, and canonical apply returns the stable outcome. Negative flow: minority, stale term/owner, invalid peer MAC/replay or denied principal cannot establish committed success. Edge/error flow: an unknown response is resolved by stable command ID; interrupted/corrupt append or snapshot reopens one verified cut or fails explicitly; cancellation drains owned work without transferring locks to a migrating activation.

TASK-RF3-ELECTION-RETRY-R80 preserves AC-REP-003 after exact2ecbeee4d /
run37093992229/job111123331985:62 of63 tests passed, and LeaderLossScenario queue
Receive returned UnknownWriteOutcome with the documented same-command-ID retry.
Freeze queue Receive/Processing and projection replay requests before using the
existing election helper, as subscription writes already do. Preserve its strict
UnknownWriteOutcome/OwnershipLost whitelist,250ms cadence, original two-minute
scenario deadline and every receipt/single-delivery/ACK/minority/recovery oracle.
No new IDs inside retries, added sleeps, product retry/shim or exception waiver.
Existing leader-kill RF3 is the failing regression; actual later delivered-SHA
GitHub RF3 success closes it. Cohesive LeaderLossQueueScenario owns only this queue
flow, called with the existing fixed collection/queue names; all original exact
data/effect/ACK checks remain, while the original scenario stays under200LOC.
ADR-003/007/036 cover the unchanged fault contract.

AC-REP-006 additionally maps to existing cryptographic/replay source cases in the [ClusterReplication unit slice](../../tests/KeyLoad.UnitTests/Features/ClusterReplication/) and planned real RF3 saturation/failover cases. Pure envelope tests do not prove liveness under load. Every acknowledgement/recovery assertion needs the exact delivered GitHub run; fault/endurance/power-loss claims remain separate.

Related invariants: [ADR-003](../ADR/ADR-003-durability-ack-barrier.md) ACK/profile barriers, [ADR-007](../ADR/ADR-007-replica-consensus-bootstrap.md) consensus/bootstrap, [ADR-016](../ADR/ADR-016-atomic-physical-placement.md) atomic identity/placement and [ADR-017](../ADR/ADR-017-ownership-session-tokens.md) current ownership-session tokens. Physical movement must preserve or explicitly invalidate those tokens under its separately qualified contract.

TASK-REP-DISCOVERY removes the obsolete HTTP consensus/body-spooling protocol.
PeerSecurity authenticates only a bodyless GET of /internal/silo with no query;
native signed envelopes own votes, append payloads and snapshots. The discovery
signature binds a versioned purpose, exact method, recipient authority, path,
timestamp and nonce. A fixed-capacity nonce table rejects saturation explicitly,
retains a nonce through its inclusive future validity, and does not admit malformed
or forged requests. The clock is injected TimeProvider.System in production.
Real request-object security cases cover tamper/replay/expiry/body/path/method and
capacity, while RF3 CI exercises the genuine sockets and signed discovery reply.
No HTTP handler fake or legacy body fallback remains.

## Bounded intentional restart health wait refinement

REQ-REP-050 maps to AC-REP-050 and AC-ISO-004: after a deliberate native Docker kill
and one Aspire Start command, health waiting uses the native recovery wait behavior
with the original cancellation/deadline. Old unavailable logical-resource snapshots
must not immediately abort a requested restart. Actual healthy result, fresh Docker
Running/changed-start/source identity, public SDK readiness, persisted command/data/
subscription/outbox recovery and minority rejection remain required. Initial startup
keeps its existing fail-fast behavior; no retries, longer deadlines or swallowed
failures. Existing `ReplicatedAtomicBatchSurvivesLeaderContainerKillAndMinorityRejectsWrites`
is the real acceptance regression, executed in exact-SHA Linux RF3 CI. TASK-AISQL-024
retained run37072003906 evidence supports stale-terminal handling; exact selected
Aspire event generation remains unproven. TASK-AISQL-025/root owns only the two
post-restart health waits; ADR036 existing lifecycle contract is sufficient, new
architecture ADR:N/A. Qualification remains pending.

## Atomic checkpoint metadata publication

REQ-REP-051 maps to AC-REP-051: every node shares one log-owned protocol gate for
term/append/follower planning and checkpoint metadata publication. Real canonical
snapshot capture/verification/install IO remains outside that gate. A checkpoint
cannot advance the compacted cut between an authenticated protocol operation's
metadata, term and suffix reads; ordinary concurrent publication cannot poison a
healthy replica. The materializer borrows the gate, drains its apply work and does
not dispose the log owner's gate; physical log disposal closes it after consensus
and materializer drain. Existing snapshot cut, tail, quorum, incarnation, transfer
and process-durable acknowledgement rules remain strict.

AC-REP-051 requires tests on genuine ZoneTree log/canonical stores proving the same
gate instance, blocked metadata publication while a real planning scope is held,
then exact verified snapshot publication/tail read and preserved metadata after
release. Cover direct Create and completed incoming transfer publication,
successful and faulted materializer disposal, and actual log-owner closure. Existing
process-crash/snapshot tests and 1/2/3 native intensive seeding/read plus RF3 SDK/MCP
fault gates must pass at the repaired SHA. TASK-ISO-016K-F and ADR007 own the ordered
contract; no injected storage substitute, silent retry, lost cut or changed quorum
is acceptable. Source races are established independently from the unresolved
cf630 OwnershipLost runtime attribution; exact native node logs remain necessary.

TASK-REP-MATERIALIZER-FAULT-ORACLE refines AC-REP-002/004/051 without changing
production shutdown. In the real ZoneTree JournalFlushed failure flow, the pending
apply waiter must fail with RecoveryRequired and the memoized disposal task must
preserve its original UnknownWriteOutcome. Successful resource cleanup does not
require a successful terminal task. Assert repeated disposal observes the same
original exception, the borrowed log gate stays usable until its physical owner
closes, and reopening retains the committed prefix and storage identity.
The lifecycle fixture may acknowledge only that exact terminal exception after
the scenario has asserted it; any different exception, unasserted failure or
independent owner/directory cleanup error remains fatal to the test. Keep the
normal/concurrent disposal and filesystem-failure regressions. The owning paths
are RecoveryTests/Features/ClusterReplication/Cases/ReplicaMaterializerLifecycleTests.cs
and Fixtures/ReplicaMaterializerLifecycleFixture.cs. Native TUnit recovery and
exact-source Linux recovery reports qualify this test correction; they do not
close RF3, endurance or power-loss gates. ADR-007 preserves the failure contract.


## TASK-ISO-021 accepted application/control read separation

REQ/AC-REP-006 and AC-ISO-003/004/005 remain the correctness/qualification gates.
Source b474 proves application quorum rounds spend Critical capacity via empty
Append. Actual native RF2 OwnershipLost/RF3 ResourceExhausted do not yet prove
which replay pool first overflowed; preserve that uncertainty and failed samples.

Append signed method ordinals ReadProbe=7 and ControlReadBarrier=8; old0..6,
envelope version, exact HMAC method binding, generation, nonce, freshness,
full-lifetime cross-method replay and durable formats stay unchanged. ReadProbe
uses the existing strict AppendRequest parser with initialized empty Entries
and declared LeaderId equal to authenticated sender. Any data/control entry,
default/null entries, malformed/duplicate/unknown/trailing field, invalid header
or over-budget body fails before receiver/ObserveLeader/state mutation. Valid
ReadProbe consumes ReadBarrier. Ordinary heartbeat/control empty Append stays
Critical. Application-origin nonempty catchup fallback uses empty ReadProbe;
control/write fallback keeps ordinary Append. Snapshot/data semantics unchanged.

ReplicaLeader uses an internal closed purpose, never a public caller flag.
ReplicaConsensus adds trusted ReadControlBarrierAsync sharing the actual bounded
read core/readiness/activity/lifetime/10s/quorum/term/cut/apply semantics. Remote
control uses signed strict-empty-string ControlReadBarrier/Critical; local
control round uses ordinary empty Append. Existing public ReadBarrier retains
application purpose. No ICommitCoordinator/HTTP/SQL/SDK/MCP/authorization change.

ReplicaMembershipTable constructor now requires the actual ReplicaConsensus
instead of IReplicaEndpoint; the sole production construction already supplies
partition.Consensus. Change the source signature coherently, with no legacy
overload/cast/compatibility fallback. ReplicaMembershipStore receives that same
node-owned consensus and calls trusted control read; membership writes retain
coordinator/atomic CAS. Preserve true caller cancellation; independent native
deadline/lifetime cancellation maps OwnershipLost as the original coordinator.

Disjoint ownership: root enum, strict Orleans replay/sender classification,
membership source join, fixed quota diagnostics, benchmark-only profile/env,
shared docs and integration. gates_audit owns Replication ReplicaConsensus.cs,
ReplicaLeader.cs, ReplicaFollowerSender.cs, ReplicaRequestDispatcher.cs and NEW
cohesive prefixed purpose/guard helpers plus NEW focused real-node tests under
RecoveryTests/Features/ClusterReplication. Escalate if a test needs a shared
fixture edit; no synthetic successful transport, gate/quorum/term/retry relaxation
or public/shared abstraction edits. Tests first use actual stored nodes and
real protocol. Root new security TUnit tests cover valid signed methods, empty
guards, wrong sender/MAC, malformed/nonempty/null fields, cross-method replay,
separate capacity denial and unchanged old method/data/snapshot classification.

Quota diagnostic snapshot is captured atomically at capacity denial and emitted
after the lock: configured numeric sender index, closed method/pool, counts and
limits, Unix timestamp/oldest expiry. No identity/address/nonce/payload/credential/
exception text. Fixed per-sender/pool state emits first then at most once30s,
with saturating suppressed count; no success-path allocation/unbounded keys/IO.
Original authenticated ResourceExhausted classification remains unchanged.

Benchmark-only ReadBarrierPerVoter196608 with original Critical16384/Forward32768/
DataAppend32768 yields278528 per voter,835584 per RF3 node, below1048576.
Production defaults stay unchanged. Retain actual rolling occupancy/expiry and
exact node config; this arithmetic does not guarantee complete CRUD/queue cells
or throughput. Every public successful call still performs two authorized
quorum barriers; do not remove persisted authorization or cache it here.

Ordered stages: failing acceptance-derived tests; bounded source implementation;
root review/build/format/governance; exact-SHA full normal/scalar/138 recovery/
RF3 and native KeyLoad1/2/3; then genuine control-pressure/failover proof and
all270 before aggregation/site. Native control execution/membership-under-load
observer remains a separately frozen required join, not inferred from admission
or absence of warnings. Public auth/lease reserve liveness remains unqualified.
All test/runtime execution is GitHub only. Homogeneous all-voter rollout and
rollback preserves local stores/journals; old nodes fail closed on new methods,
no mixed-version availability promise. ADR remains Accepted pending all evidence.


TASK-ISO-021R source review closes the new-method index overflow boundary:
ReadProbe rejects PreviousIndex=Int64.MaxValue before replay admission, even
with otherwise valid positive term/previousTerm and empty entries. Genuine
signed MaximumPreviousIndexFailsBeforeReplayAdmission asserts Validation and
both one-slot pools remain available. Existing Append semantics are unchanged.
Source review also confirms fixed rate state/atomic snapshots and actual native
DI/Consensus ownership; native control-under-load and provider-failure evidence
remain open, with no inferred successful runtime result.


## Embedded final clock ordering, TASK-EMBEDDED-CLOCK-ORDER-001

EmbeddedCoordinator is the product-owned real standalone admission coordinator over DatabaseEngine and its native ZoneTree Store.Commit gate. For coordinator-owned JSON/native submissions, bounded validation/normalization stays before commit; the final EvaluationClock.GetUtcNow sample is selected inside the original Store.Commit callback immediately before the existing ApplyCommittedCommand. Retain exactly one commit and the shared authorization/outcome/fingerprint/strict ValidateCommandClock pipeline. Public Apply(ReplicatedOperation, replicationIndex) retains supplied canonical EvaluatedAt unchanged. This matches RF3 ReplicaLeader final timestamp selection under rounds and state.LockedAsync before ordered append; embedded ownership does not qualify RF3. No clamp, retry, backward-clock acceptance, fence reset or second coordinator lock is allowed. Cancellation is rechecked inside admission before clock selection; synchronous original apply settles before return. TASK-EMBEDDED-CLOCK-ORDER-001 maps REQ-REP-001 and AC-REP-001, and native durable-job clock/owner contracts under ADR-028/ADR-110. Preserve original R308 four journal-fence failures. Root validates all five NativeSagaTimeoutFunctionalTests actual native job operations, plus existing strict stale-clock/replay tests, normal/scalar and required Linux/RF3 gates. No result or source review closes these runtime predicates.
