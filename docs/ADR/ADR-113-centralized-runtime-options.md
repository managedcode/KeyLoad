# ADR-113: General runtime literals and centralized typed options

Status: Accepted (implementation and verification pending)
Date: 2026-10-06

The owner explicitly requires complete runtime literal migration, including
endpoint/method tokens, and rejects per-class timeout constants. CodeQuality
REQ-CQ-012/013 and AC-CQ-033..038 supersede the selected-context scope in ADR-111.
Immutable identities use feature-owned constants/nameof. Operational policy uses
centrally bound and validated native IOptions<T>, consumed by its execution owner.

Keep scenario options in their owning Features/<Slice>/Configuration role; register
them through the server/AppHost composition boundary. Defaults retain current
values and live only in these canonical definitions. Group settings by actual
ownership; do not build a universal untyped dictionary or a giant options bag.
Mark actual configuration options/binding boundaries with KeyLoad-owned metadata
so semantic compiler rules can distinguish them from public request DTOs. The
marker is descriptive: it never replaces actual registration, validation or tests.

Existing NodeOptions binds under its unchanged KeyLoad section, with existing
strict section validation before native options execution. Feature constructors
receive IOptions<NodeOptions> and retain one validated snapshot. AppHost must bind
and validate its typed selection options before building the resource graph; its
native options factory/DI lifecycle is owned and disposed, and no raw provider
escapes to feature execution. CLI/env names and malformed/unknown-setting failure
contracts remain exact. Persisted authorization and RF3 membership cannot be
configured away. Preserve serializer Id/Alias, native bytes and canonical digests.


Persisted user policies (queue/subscription/retention) and explicit caller request
parameters are domain data, not server execution configuration. Their stable
public/serialized default values remain feature-owned named protocol constants;
keep native generated Alias/Id contracts and bytes. Do not inject IOptions into
payloads or mark arbitrary execution helpers as policy definitions. Host limits,
implicit execution defaults and timing/admission/cache budgets still require their
actual native options owner. Immutable RF3 membership cardinality and required
qualification sample counts remain contract identities.

AppHost resource observation binds native ScaleServerResourceOptions before graph
composition and shares the same wrapper through collector/process/helper joins.
Configured sampling, cleanup, file/output and work budgets must retain their actual
values in observation evidence. Frozen native provenance options are populated only
from original environment values at the central boundary; execution classes cannot
read environment directly. Preserve original source/run/attempt/job authentication
and never refresh published measurements from this refactor.

DueCoordination first removes DispatchDeadlineSeconds/DispatchDeadline and the
service PollInterval from arbitrary classes. A feature-owned options type supplies
both grain and grain service via silo DI; central registration binds defaults and
overrides and validates ranges on startup. Capture configured values per operation;
do not introduce live policy mutation mid-dispatch or alter joined shutdown.

TASK-CQ-GENERAL-001..005 and exact disjoint ownership are frozen in the feature
contract. Lead owns markers/shared package references, central registration,
AppHost configuration, all shared docs/configuration and final joins. Worker002
owns analyzer/tests/tooling;003 owns core/storage/replication;004 owns server and
Orleans execution plus clients/benchmarks, excluding lead's central binding files.
No delegated boundary implementation starts before this contract is available.

The integrated ownership extends002 to shared UnitTests API joins,003 to the
Comparison library's immutable identities and adapter policies, and lead to the
ComparisonHost startup/native-option factories and IntegrationTests joins.004
retains Server/Orleans/Client/CLI/BenchmarkScenarios. These are disjoint portions
of the same general migration; they do not add database features.

The native registries group actual owners: Core database/due-work/messaging/query/
graph/change-feed/time-series/search/cache execution; Server node-derived authority,
replica/discovery/transport/membership/routing/admission/MCP/probe/text/upgrade/admin
execution; AppHost startup/selectors/test/process/image/profile/RF3 composition/
benchmark deployment and observation. CLI and comparison hosts use native
OptionsFactory/OptionsManager before client or file construction. Strict immutable
comparison connection/identity snapshots use the native factory's CreateInstance
hook with the existing validating parser, preserving unknown-input diagnostics and
secrets. No temporary provider or Options.Create fallback supplies runtime defaults.

AppHost's native bootstrap selectors are admitted before dashboard selection.
Private-profile byte/path/buffer/depth options reach reads, parsing and writes;
oversized writes fail before creating a staged file. Source/run/attempt/job identity
remains original environment provenance. Resource observation emits version2 with
the actual primitive policy; aggregation validates it, enforces its sample/mount
ceilings and rejects different policies within a comparable cohort. Existing
version1 evidence remains historical input. This metadata schema change does not
change persisted database formats or qualify new performance measurements.

Verification order is a real full Release build, scoped native formatting and a
final full build, then Aspire-owned analyzers/unit/scalar/recovery/RF3 plus the
existing coverage/architecture gates. Configured behavior tests include
CentralAppHostOptionsTests, PhysicalShardProfileBoundedReadTests, native resource
policy/mismatch cases in ScaleServerResourceEvidenceParserTests, and the real
DueCoordination/ReplicaExecution/ZoneTreeStorage execution regressions. Each suite
must retain its original native outcome and exact source; compiler previews remain
diagnostic tools only.

Dependencies use centrally pinned native Microsoft.Extensions.Options/Binder
packages already present or explicitly added in the canonical package manifest;
do not copy framework or ManagedCode implementations. Native Options.Create is
permitted for explicitly validated standalone/test caller composition, not a fake
options implementation or a hidden fallback replacing central server DI.

Rollout is one coherent source rebuild. Preserve defaults/sections and fail invalid
configuration before readiness/admission. Constructor/configuration ownership
changes update every actual call site and real regression in the same stage. No
compatibility constructor silently restores hardcoded policy. Rollback reverts the
coherent ownership/rule migration while preserving persisted data and all earlier
gates. Do not mark this decision Implemented until complete build, formatter,
Aspire full analyzer/unit/scalar/recovery/RF3, coverage and exact-source evidence
exist. Local compiler previews and passing focused tests remain development proof.
